Remote Control Car Using Arduino Uno and HC-05 Bluetooth Modules
This project showcases a remote-controlled car powered by an Arduino Uno. The car is driven by four motors and controlled wirelessly 
via Bluetooth using an HC-05 module. The remote control is built using an Arduino Nano, a joystick, and another HC-05 Bluetooth module.

Features
Wireless Control: Bluetooth communication enables seamless wireless operation.

Joystick Navigation: Intuitive control of car movement using a joystick.

Multi-Motor Drive: Four motors provide stability and maneuverability.

Modular Design: Separate units for the car and the remote control for ease of maintenance and upgrades.
